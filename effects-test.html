          Schizophrenia is a mental illness whose symptoms usually occur in phases.
          It is a type of psychosis, which means you can’t always tell the difference between what's real and what's a thought inside your head.
          Try typing out some of your inner thoughts and watch as they morph into the simulations of the various phases. For more details, check out
          the research here.

        <div id="phase1_desc">
          In the first, prodromal phase, friends and family might notice strange
          behavior. You might want to be alone much of the time and may start to
          talk only about certain topics, such as religion, the government, or a
          particular public figure. This phase can last from weeks to years.
          Some people with schizophrenia never go past this point, but most do.

          The active phase (sometimes called “acute”), can be the most alarming
          to friends and family. It causes symptoms of psychosis like delusions,
          hallucinations, and jumbled speech and thoughts. Sometimes, this phase
          appears suddenly without a prodromal stage.

        <div id="phase3_desc">
          Doctors sometimes call this the “recovery” phase. In many ways, it
          mirrors the prodromal phase. The more intense symptoms, like
          hallucinations, start to fade. But you may still have some strange
          beliefs. You're also likely to withdraw into yourself and talk less.
          You might have trouble concentrating or keeping your thoughts
          straight. You can become depressed as you become aware of the episode.
